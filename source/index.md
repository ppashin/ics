# Introduction

Welcome to the International Chauffeured Service API! You can use our API to get our rates for Point to Point, Hourly and Daily car bookings. You can make a booking via ICS API.

We have language bindings in Shell. You can view code examples in the dark area to the right, and you can switch the programming language of the examples with the tabs in the top right.

This example API documentation page was created with [Slate](http://github.com/tripit/slate). Feel free to edit it and use it as a base for your own APIs documentation.

# Authentication

> To authorize, use this code:

```shell
# With shell, you can just pass the correct header with each request
curl "https://e-zbookings.com/api/v1"
  -H "Authorization: Basic base64encodedkeyandsecret"
```

> Make sure to replace `base64encodedkeyandsecret` with your API credentials.

ICS uses API keys to allow access to the API. You can get ICS API key by contacting us at http://bookalimo.com/connect-with-us

We expects for the API credentials to be included only in the pay requess to the server in a header that looks like the following:

`Authorization: Basic base64encodedkeyandsecret`

<aside class="notice">
You must replace <code>base64encodedkeyandsecret</code> with your personal API credentials.
